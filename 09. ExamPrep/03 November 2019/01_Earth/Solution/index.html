            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
            object known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and
            other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
            Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital
            plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction
            between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
            orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
